# What is a Key-Value Pair?

A **key-value pair** is a simple data structure:

key → value


---

## Real-life example

Name → Dipen
City → Mumbai


---

## Kubernetes example

- **Key**: Unique path
- **Value**: Object data stored as JSON

---

## Why this matters

Kubernetes stores **everything internally as key-value data**.

Understanding key-value storage means understanding:
- How Kubernetes tracks state
- How desired vs actual state is stored
- How recovery and reconciliation work
