Master Node Components

ETCD Cluster: Stores cluster-wide configuration and state data.
Kube Scheduler: Determines the best node for new container deployments.
Controllers: Manage node lifecycle, container replication, and system stability.
Kube API Server: Acts as the central hub for cluster communication and management.

Worker Node Components

Kubelet: Manages container lifecycle on an individual node. It receives instructions from the Kube API server to create, update, or delete containers, and regularly reports the node's status.
Kube Proxy: Configures networking rules on worker nodes, thus enabling smooth inter-container communication across nodes. For instance, it allows a web server on one node to interact with a database on another.


Note: The Kubernetes replication controller and other controllers work like dock office staff, ensuring that the desired number of containers are running and managing node operations.
Note: The entire control system is containerized. Whether you are using Docker, Containerd, or CRI-O, every node (including master nodes with containerized components) requires a compatible container runtime engine.
